 #Roving Traders
 RT_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Why did I even answer this hail..."
 RT_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] threatens our peoples' sedentary way of life. Expect very little from us."
 RT_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Why would we talk to those who would throw the [Root.GetSpeciesName] from their borders? You do not even give us a chance, why should we?"
 RT_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We will not harm you, we only wish to travel and trade as we go. But we will defend ourselves if must be."
 RT_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Greeting [From.GetName]. Is there an exchange you wish to conduct?"
 RT_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Curious... what can we do for the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] people?"

 RT_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "It is always good to see our xenophilic allies amongst our people! What proposals do you have for us?"
 RT_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Very well then, if this is what must be done then so be it! "
 RT_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "You will learn that we are not just a band of simple merchants!"
 RT_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "But... this doesn't make any sense... you were so friendly with us..."
 RT_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "We knew you would one day strike, but know that we will give it our all to defeat you!"
 RT_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "How may I serve [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] and the [From.GetName]?"
 RT_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Our [Root.GetRulerTitle] begins to grow restless with the [From.GetName]..."
