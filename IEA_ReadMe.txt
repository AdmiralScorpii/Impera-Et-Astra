About Impera Et Astra:

Mod Mission:
"To increase the variety that vanilla Stellaris can provide through governments, changing how ethics relates to choosing said governments, more varied 
and fleshed out economic and resource chains, and more to be planned for the future."

Impera Et Astra is a major overhaul mod for Paradox's "Stellaris" 4X space game. The mod was first conceived as a government overhaul of Stellaris
but plans to do much more, including overhauling colonization, technologies, buildings, resources and the economy, and more.
